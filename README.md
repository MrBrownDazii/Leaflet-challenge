# Visualizing Earthquake Data with Leaflet

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)


Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. 

I've created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes in the last 7 days from the United States Geological Survey GeoJSON Feed page. Examined and illustrated the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.

Below are the Programming languages used for this project:
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Leaflet
- HTML
- CSS
- D3
- GeoJSON
